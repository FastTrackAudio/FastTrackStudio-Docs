title: Four Ways to Use Compression
---

Compression is a tool that we use to change the balance of the transient and tail of an audio file.

## Key Parameters

- **Threshold**: Tells the compressor which notes to press, not how much to compress them
- **Ratio**: Tells the compressor how much to compress what's above the threshold
- **Attack**: How quickly the compressor responds to the input signal
- **Release**: How quickly the compressor returns to the idle state after the input signal is below the threshold

## The Four Compression Styles

|                  | Fast Attack | Slow Attack |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Fast Release** | THICK       | Groovy      |
| **Slow Release** | Consistent  | Punchy      |

## Attack and Release Timing

### What is Fast or Slow Attack?

- **Fast Attack**: 1 ms
- **Slow Attack**:
  - 30-50ms for Percussive sounds
  - 50-100ms for sustained sounds

### What is Fast or Slow Release?

- **Fast Release**: 10-20ms
- **Slow Release**: 500ms-1 second

## Compression Styles Explained

### Thick Compression

- **Attack**: FAST (1 ms) - Decreases Transient
- **Release**: FAST (30 ms) - Increases Tail (With Makeup Gain)

### Groovy Compression

- **Attack**: SLOW (50 ms) - Increases Transient
- **Release**: FAST (10-20 ms)

### Consistent Compression

- Focused on macro dynamics
- Release should be slow enough that it barely gets back to 0 before the next transient
- **Attack**: FAST (1 ms)
- **Release**: SLOW (500ms-1 second)

### Punchy Compression

- **Attack**: Slow (50ms) - Increases Transient
- **Release**: Slow (500ms-1 second) - Decreases Tail
